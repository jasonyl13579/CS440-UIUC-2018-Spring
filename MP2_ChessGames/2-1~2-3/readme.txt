Change the following inside the class "Gomoku"
private final int red = 2; 0:alpha-beta 1:reflex 2:minimax 3:stochastic
private final int blue = 2; 0:alpha-beta 1:reflex 2:minimax 3:stochastic

ex:if we change red from 2 to 0, we can use alpha-beta search for agent 1
ex:if we change blue from 2 to 3, we can use stochastic search for agent 2
